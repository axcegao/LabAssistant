# LabAssistant - Telegram Bot for Scientific Calculations
```

LabAssistant is a Telegram bot designed to assist young scientists with various calculations and data processing tasks.

## Features

1. **Unit Conversion**:
   - Frequency ↔ Wavelength
   - Energy ↔ Wavelength
2. **Spectrum Analysis**:
   - Calculate resonance position and FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum) from a spectrum file.
   - Plot the spectrum with marked resonance and FWHM.
3. **Laser Fluence Calculation**:
   - Compute fluence from average power, area, and repetition rate.
4. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from users to improve the bot.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `python-telegram-bot` (`pip install python-telegram-bot`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python-telegram-bot numpy matplotlib
   ```
Replace the TOKEN in the script with your Telegram bot token:

```python
TOKEN = "your_telegram_bot_token"
```

## Usage

Start the bot:
```bash
python LabAssistant.py
```

## Commands
/start: Start the bot and see welcome message.
/function: List all available features.
/select_calc: Choose a calculation (unit conversion, spectrum analysis, or fluence calculation).

## Spectrum File Format
Upload a .txt file with two columns: wavelength (nm) and intensity. Example:
400 0.1
401 0.15
402 0.3
...
Example Workflow
Unit Conversion:

## Select "Frequency->Wavelength".
Enter the frequency in Hz.
The bot will return the wavelength and its range (e.g., visible light, infrared).

## Spectrum Analysis:
Upload a spectrum file.
The bot will return the resonance position and FWHM, along with a plot.

## Fluence Calculation:
Enter average power (W), area (cm²), and repetition rate (Hz).
The bot will return the fluence in J/cm².

## Feedback
The bot includes a feedback system. After each calculation, users can rate their experience and suggest improvements.

## Notes
Ensure the spectrum file is correctly formatted for accurate analysis.
For unit conversions, use scientific notation (e.g., 1e-9 for nanometers).
